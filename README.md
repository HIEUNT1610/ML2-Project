NLP Project 
Improving vector space representations using semantic resources
================
This is the end of semester project for the class Machine Learning for NLP at the University Paris Cite'. The task is to study the retrofitting algorithm by Faruqui (2015) to improve off-the-shelf word embeddings using semantic resources (WordNet).

1. Tasks.
   1. Read Faruqui (2015), his algorithm, and understand the task.
   2. Find better $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values for the model.
   3. Find stopping criteria for the model.
   4. Implement the model in Python, using the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and stopping criteria values you found.
   5. Run the model on the data, and evaluate the results on a lexical similarity task, then on a sentiment analysis task.

2. Materials.
   1. Algorithm: Faruqui (2015). https://github.com/mfaruqui/retrofitting
   2. Semantic resources: WordNet, FrameNet. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmPAj07k_dKqaKpwEnqaT1gL1RKrXOuB/view?usp=share_link
